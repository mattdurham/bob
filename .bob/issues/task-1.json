  "description": "Create a web UI for viewing Bob's state, workflows, and tasks.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Must be a separate command/binary (NOT part of the MCP server)\n- Should read from ~/.bob folder to access state\n- Display current workflows and their progress\n- Show active tasks and their status\n- Should NOT run when Bob is serving as MCP server (since multiple instances can spawn)\n\n**Implementation approach:**\n- Create new cmd (e.g., `cmd/bob-ui/` or `bob ui` subcommand)\n- Read from ~/.bob/state/db.sql database\n- Display workflows, tasks, and session state\n- Consider a simple HTTP server with HTML/JS frontend\n- Allow viewing workflow progress, task dependencies, and active sessions",
